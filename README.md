### Exploring Youth Tobacco and E-cigarette/Vaping Trends in the United States: 2015-2019 using R Markdown

**Background**:
Tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, are known to pose substantial health risks due to the presence of harmful substances such as carcinogens, heavy metals, and hazardous particles. Furthermore, the emergence of e-cigarette and vaping products has raised concerns, as counterfeit versions can contain additional dangerous chemicals. To address these concerns, this project leverages data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS).

**Introduction**:
This comprehensive case study delves into the evolving landscape of tobacco and e-cigarette/vaping use among American youths over the span of 2015 to 2019. The investigation encompasses several vital aspects:

**Trend Analysis**: The primary objective is to scrutinize how the utilization of tobacco and e-cigarette/vaping products by American youths has evolved since 2015. This will offer valuable insights into the changing patterns of substance use among adolescents.

**Gender Disparities**: We aim to discern potential gender-based differences in e-cigarette use, exploring whether males and females exhibit distinct usage patterns and preferences.

**Brand and Flavor Preferences**: Identifying the most frequently used vaping brands and flavors among adolescents is another crucial aspect of this study. Understanding the appeal of specific brands and flavors can provide actionable data for regulatory measures.

**Comprehensive Tobacco Use**: This investigation extends its scope to analyze the relationship between e-cigarette/vaping use and other forms of tobacco consumption. This broader perspective will help uncover potential pathways to substance initiation.

As the case study unfolds, we remain open to exploring additional research questions that may arise during the course of our analysis. Understanding the trends in youth tobacco and e-cigarette use is of paramount importance, as early initiation of smoking can lead to serious health consequences. By pinpointing when children are most susceptible to starting these habits, we aspire to inform targeted legislation and interventions that safeguard young people from the perils of tobacco and e-cigarette use.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to contribute invaluable insights to the ongoing efforts to combat youth tobacco and e-cigarette/vaping usage, thereby fostering the development of effective strategies and interventions aimed at protecting the health and well-being of the nation's youth.
